# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending Club is a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.

## Problem Statement
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

Hence, company wants to understand the driving factors which impact loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilize this knownledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

* Univariate Analysis-
> Analysing each columns and plotting the distribution of each to get more information.
* Segmented Univariate Analysis-
> To get more insight of single data variables in the form of segments.
* Bivariate Analysis-
> Through this we can analyse two variables and determine empirical relationship between them.
